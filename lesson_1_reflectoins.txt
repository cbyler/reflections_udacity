1, vewing a diff file helped me to see the bug beter becuase it only highlighted the differeces vs. me having to manually go through thousands of lines of codes to spot the bug 

2.Having access to the entire history of a file his helpful because you can see what you changed and how this is affecting the outcome of the file
cons of not having versions automatically saved is that you can lose files if you aren't careful, no way to go back and retrieve, pros are being able to intentionally save a version so you know exactly what you did to improve the file 

3.Git allows person to save multiple files in one commit but google docs treats each file separately...this is better because you are able to track changes across files which are interrelated

4. using git log you can see the history of all your commits including the author and a brief comment-git diff is helpful because it can compare multiple commits within this history to indicate the differences
