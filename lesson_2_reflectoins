1. When you initialize a repository git converts a directory to a git repository but it does not create initial commits for any of these files-you have to do it yourself. It also indicates how none of the files are being tracked because no history exists
2. The staging area provides a halway point in between the wd and repos. becuase it allows you to commit two files to staging area, but then bundle these in to the repository in a single commit
3. Branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized because you can keep one that you know works and then create separate branches depending on what you want to try. Then, if you continue making changes to the master branch and merge it later if you get the experimental stage to work
